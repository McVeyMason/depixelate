# Depixelate
This program depixelates images of a certain font using Java. 
It uses a procedural apporach by trying one letter at a time and computing the
difference between the two images. Inspired by (https://github.com/beurtschipper/Depix) and (https://github.com/BishopFox/unredacter) although no code was borrowed.
I found Java to be a much more appropriate language as it is much much faster and has native support for image gerneration and manipulation.
